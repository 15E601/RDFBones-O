This is the [RDFBones](https://github.com/RDFBones) core ontology for osteological research data from anthropological investigations. All files in the repository need to be loaded into one graph. Currently, the VIVO ontology ([vivo.owl](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO/blob/develop/home/src/main/resources/rdf/tbox/filegraph/vivo.owl)) is also required in addition.
